            <h2>What Pocketts is all about</h2>
            <p>
                I made this app, up to this point, with React Js. Styling was
                made with styled-components, everything is basically css-in-js.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Pocketts</b> allows you to have an electronic wallet, and by
                registering your contacts, it makes the process of transferring
                any currency more fluid.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                As you could tell, the app is not fully functional. It still
                needs a lot of back end to say that is secure and reliable.
                Right now it is only a <b>MOCKUP</b>. I am constantly working on
                the front end logic, making it as modular as it can be.
